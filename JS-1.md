Java vs JavaScript [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C5AHaS1mOA)

## 2 Javascript Alerts

- Chrome -> Developer Tools -> Sources -> Snippets

- New snippets -> `alert("Hello world!");` -> Run (alt + Enter) 
- Same below line type -> `say("Hello world!");` -> Run (alt + Enter) ->  *Error* becoz `say()` is not a function

- Or **you can write in seperate documnet *html* file**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>alert("Hello world!");</script>
</body>
</html>
```

> window.alert() instructs the browser to display a dialog with an optional message, and to wait until the user dismisses the dialog.
